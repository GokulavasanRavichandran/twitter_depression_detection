## Overview

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook play dominant roles in our day to day life. The popularity of these platforms has been significantly increased during the pandemic. Studies show that people are more likely to share their feelings and emotions on Twitter since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Positive emotions are not commonly associated with higher life satisfaction; however, negative emotions are more likely to express a person true feelings. 

Depression is the most common mental disorder which is more than just being sad. Some signs of depression are lack of interest in daily activities, significant weight loss or gain, insomnia or excessive sleeping, lack of energy, inability to concentrate, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt and in severe cases recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Auspiciously, depression is treatable. The treatment is a combination of therapy and antidepressant medication.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to implement supervised machine learning techniques in order to detect tweets containing depressive characteristics. 

## Datasets

* Extract more than 20K tweets by using [Twitter API and Tweepy library](https://github.com/miladrezazadeh/twitter_depression_detection/blob/main/notebooks/data_gathering_twitter_API.ipynb). The raw data is located in [here](https://github.com/miladrezazadeh/twitter_depression_detection/tree/main/data/raw/scrapped)
